	 req - a programmable calculator using rewrite rules

To build: 	make
To run: 	cp reqrc ~/.reqrc; ./req

Example runs:

 $ req 2+3
 5
 $ req
 > sphere_area(?r) == 4 * pi * ?r^2
 ok
 > sphere_area(R_earth) / (1 mile)^2   # Earth's surface area in square miles

This was my first largeish C program, written in the late 1980s. I do
use it all the time as a calculator (it's handy with the physical
constants and units), but I don't maintain or support it.

Thanks to Steve Jenson for getting it to build on OS X.
